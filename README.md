# Website Redirect
An Alfred (alfredapp.com) extension to easily create a redirect

With this extension installed, opening Alfred and typing "redirect (name) (url)" will create a redirect page on my personal website, nward.co. Visiting nward.co/name will redirect to the given url. For instance, by opening Alfred (with Option-Space) and entering "redirect github https://github.com/kingsyphax?tab=repositories", I immediately create a redirect at nward.co/github. Alfred alerts me that the redirect creation was successful, and when I visit the shortcut, I go to my GitHub. :-D
